# TODO

1. prod АСФР-017594 missing from `prods`
2. Use prod status to show and to select base to measure budget deviation
3. find production start and finish dates. Assume linear target. Build earned value chart (see ticket description)
4. extract order No to a variable
5. dockerize, run as a service. Will need timestamp for this
